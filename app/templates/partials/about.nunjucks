		I'm currently a web developer for <a href="https://www.yardi.com" aria-label="Yardi Systems Home">Yardi Systems</a> in Dallas, TX.  I graduated from <a href="https://www.smu.edu" aria-label="SMU Home">Southern Methodist University</a> with a degree in Computer Science.  I develop (and occasionally design) high quality and fully functional websites.  I am able to transform a static design into a responsive, pixel perfect site. <br> In my free time, I like to practice yoga (and occasionally go to spin class), catch up with friends, and sit on the couch not really doing anything (like scrolling endlessly on my phone or binging Netflix/Hulu/YouTube).
