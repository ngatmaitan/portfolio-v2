		I'm currently a front-end developer for <a href="https://www.bluewolf.com/" aria-label="Bluewolf Home">Bluewolf, an IBM Company</a> in Dallas, TX.  I graduated from <a href="https://www.smu.edu" aria-label="SMU Home">Southern Methodist University</a> with a degree in Computer Science.  I develop (and occasionally design) high quality and fully functional websites. I am able to transform a static design into a responsive, pixel-perfect site. <br> In my free time, I like to go to pilates, catch up with friends, and cook/bake.
