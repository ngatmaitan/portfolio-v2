		I'm currently a web developer for <a href="https://www.yardi.com" aria-label="Yardi Systems Home">Yardi Systems</a> in Dallas, TX.  I graduated from <a href="https://www.smu.edu" aria-label="SMU Home">Southern Methodist University</a> with a degree in Computer Science.  I develop (and occasionally design) high quality and fully functional websites. I am able to transform a static design into a responsive, pixel-perfect site. <br> In my free time, I like to practice yoga (and occasionally go to spin class), catch up with friends, and cook/bake.
